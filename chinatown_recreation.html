					Due to the pandemic, most activities were forced to shut down. San Francisco' 
					Chinatown Alleyway Tours decided to take matters into their own hands and host 
					tours online through zoom and inviting attendees to a private world to continue 
					giving tours during this period. My position in this project was lead builder 
					where I would take buildings from the real world and recreate San Francisco's Chinatown 
					in Minecraft.
					<br><br>
					The recreation was possible thanks to tools such as Google Maps, people on sight that was 
					able to take pictures of angles that were hard to see, and plugins such as World Edit. Most 
					people in the Minecraft community would agree that one Minecraft block would be equivilant to roughly 
					three feet, so that was the measurement we went with when building. Google Maps has a useful tool called "Measure Distance" 
					so when we used that tool, we could accurately see the dimensions of each building.
