								<h1>San Francisco Chinatown Recreation</h1>
								<h2>2020 - 2021</h2>
								<p>
								Due to the pandemic, most activities were forced to shut down. San Francisco' 
								Chinatown Alleyway Tours decided to take matters into their own hands and host 
								tours online through zoom and inviting attendees to a private world to continue 
								giving tours during this period. My position in this project was lead builder 
								where I would take buildings from the real world and recreate San Francisco's Chinatown 
								in Minecraft.
